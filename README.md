# Description of the project
Brian.Net is a small scene based on media like Ghost in the Shell and the Matrix. Orignally intended to be much lerger, here is a smaller version of the project.

# Instructions for use
Click on the icon to get a randomised portrait and info on a character in world. Press the button on the bottom right to reroll.

# How it works
It's essentially just random range variables inside of strings, over the top of a perlin noise generated city.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
That i could actually make it, I'm not the best coder
